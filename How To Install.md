Here is a tutorial based on that point:

Installing Visual Studio Code

1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).

2. Run the installer and follow the prompts to install VS Code. Accept the default options. 

3. Once installed, launch VS Code. You now have it ready to use!

Creating Your First Project

1. Click File > Open Folder and select an empty folder to store your code projects. This will become your 'workspace'.

2. Click the Explorer icon on the left sidebar to see your workspace files. Right click in the empty space and select New File to create a new file. 

3. Name the file index.html and press Enter to create it. This will be the starting point for your app.

4. Open index.html and add some basic HTML code like `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` and save it.

Editing and Viewing Code

1. Click the index.html file in the Explorer to open it in the editor. This is where you will be editing your code.

2. Make some changes to the HTML, like adding more heading tags. Notice how VS Code provides auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

3. Right click index.html in Explorer and select 'Open with Live Server' to launch a development server and view your page in the browser.

4. Changes you make in VS Code will now be reflected live in the browser. You have an edit/view loop for rapid development!

Debugging Your Code

1. Set a breakpoint in your JavaScript code by clicking the line number in the editor gutter. This will pause execution at that line.

2. Click the Debugging icon on the left and then click the play button to start debugging. Execution will pause at the breakpoint.

3. Examine variable values, step through code line-by-line, and utilize the debugging tools during development.

That covers the basics of working with VS Code! Follow along with additional tutorials to go deeper into features like Git version control integration, extensions, and customization.
