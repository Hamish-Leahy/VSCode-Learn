Here is a tutorial on using Git version control in Visual Studio Code:

Introduction to Git in VSCode

Visual Studio Code has integrated support for Git version control. This allows you to commit, push, pull, and merge code changes directly within the editor.

Initial Setup

1. Install Git on your system if not already present.

2. Open your project folder in VSCode. 

3. Click the Source Control icon in the sidebar. Click the Initialize Repository button. This will initialize a Git repo in your project.

Make Commits

1. Make code changes to your files in VSCode. 

2. Go to the Source Control view and you'll see your changes listed in the Changes tab. 

3. Hover over a file and click the + button to stage it for commit. Repeat for all changed files you want to commit.

4. Enter a commit message in the message box at the top and click the checkmark to commit your changes.

Push and Pull

1. Click the ellipsis (...) button in the Source Control sidebar and select Push to upload your commits to the remote repository. 

2. To download commits from the remote repo, select Pull which will fetch and merge in changes.

Branching and Merging

1. To create a new branch, click the current branch name at the bottom of the Source Control view and enter the new branch name.

2. You can publish branches with Push and switch between them with the branch selector. 

3. When ready, merge branches by selecting one and clicking Merge Branch. Resolve any conflicts to complete the merge.

And that covers basic Git workflow in VSCode! The Source Control tab provides commit history and full Git command support from directly within the editor.
