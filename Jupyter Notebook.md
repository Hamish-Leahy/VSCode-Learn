Here is a tutorial on setting up Jupyter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code:

# Setting up Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code

Jupyter Notebooks are a popular tool for data analysis and visualization. This guide covers how to get started with Jupyter in VS Code.

## Install the Python Extension

First, install the Python extension from the VS Code marketplace. This will allow you to work with Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.

- Go to the Extensions view and search for "Python". 
- Install the extension by Microsoft.

## Install Jupyter

Next, open an integrated terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`) and install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

This will install the Jupyter package and dependencies.

## Create a Notebook

Now we can create a Jupyter Notebook:

- In Explorer, click `New File` and name it `my_notebook.ipynb`
- This will create a blank Jupyter Notebook.

## Run the Notebook 

To run the notebook:

- Click on the notebook file to open it
- Click on the code cell and type some Python code
- Press Shift+Enter to run the cell
- The output will be shown below the cell

## Additional Features

Some useful things you can do:

- Add more code and markdown cells 
- Leverage Intellisense, debugging, Git integration
- Install Jupyter extensions and kernels 
- Connect to a remote Jupyter server

And that's it! Jupyter Notebooks are now ready to use within VS Code for your data projects.
