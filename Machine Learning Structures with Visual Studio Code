## Introduction

Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Understanding different machine learning structures is essential for building robust and efficient models for various applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into machine learning structures, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of programming concepts (Python is recommended)
- Familiarity with Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Python and relevant libraries installed (such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn)

## Getting Started

To get started with machine learning structures in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the repository folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Explore the `examples` directory to find various machine learning structures implemented in Python.
4. Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
5. Open the Python files in the `examples` directory and follow the comments and documentation to understand the structure and implementation of each machine learning algorithm.

## Examples

In this repository, you will find examples of the following machine learning structures:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forests
5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
7. Neural Networks

Each example includes a Python script that demonstrates the implementation of the respective algorithm, along with explanations and comments to help you understand the underlying concepts.
